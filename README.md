PROBLEM STATEMENT

Anju and his girlfriend had a great time playing the game you created. His girlfriend
wants to share her experience with her friends so she asks Anju to create a social
website through which she can post her articles. But Anju has very little knowledge in
the backend since he has only worked in frontend so far. He wants your help to build
the website
Features to implement:
Basic Task:
1. Anju’s girlfriend wants her account to be secure so add an account sign-up
and Login page to make her stay secure.
2. Anju’s girlfriend wants to add content so he decides to add a create an article
page for creating articles
a. Heading
b. Bold, italic wherever necessary
c. External links wherever necessary
( Anju thinks he could format the text as HTML and store it in the database )
3. Anju’s girlfriend wants to look at all the articles so he decides to have a feed
page for all the articles to appear.
4. A profile page for the users displaying the details of the user along with the
number of articles he has posted so far and also details such as the number
of followers and following.
5. Search option to search any username and view their articles on that page
And follow them.
Advance Task:
1. In the profile page, have settings for changing username and password
2. Add additional features to the editor which can provide users to add images,
different font styles and size to the text, multi-colour text and centralizing the
specific content in the article.
3. A dashboard page for viewing all the articles the person has created with an
edit and delete option
4. Create a dashboard page containing
a. notification bar ( to indicate Anju’s new followers with seen and not
seen )
b. To traverse between pages
5. Sometimes Anju’s girlfriend forget her friend’s name so help her to identify or
complete her friend’s name by having a synchronous search in the search
option for usernames (Anju thinks of loading the result in a list below the
search box)
